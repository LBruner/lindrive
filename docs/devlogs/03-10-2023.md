### Today's Progress: ðŸš€


### Challenges Faced: ðŸ’ª
Implementing the option to track folder was kinda tiresome because of two things. The Regex wasn't working and to test it I had to restart my whol****e app, witch would take a lot of time if you take up all the times it was done. The bigger problem was the way my class was set up. It was messy. A lot of stuff inside the initial nodes were passed as arguments. And overall, it was just bad. Gotta spend sometime refactoring it since I didn't even deleted that instance when it's done what it has to.

### Thoughts and Reflections: ðŸ’­
For some reason, my app doesn't switch screens when I wait some time before loging in. Some random errors happen too. And I don't even know what caused it, so I just let it pass until the time it starts bothering me. Just a few more features and i'm probably done.

### Plans for Tomorrow: ðŸ“™

Guess I just have to fix my login screen. Improve the setup one too. I need to test the logging to file feature as well.

### Additional Notes: ðŸ—’

So close. Let's go.
