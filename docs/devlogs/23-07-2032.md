Let's not use a template today since I want to make this a possible note to return to when I can't believe in myself. So, before this note, my project used React to do the frontend and Express on backend. Now I don't have neither of them anymore. I've switched them for Electron. And that is basically both of them included inside one package. And now I'm stuck because I can't figure out how to stick it all together with Electron structure. The first really bad thing is the time it takes to reload the project. I could try Electron reloader but I don't think that'll work with webpack. I'm thinking about create a flowchart to design what I should try do first. And how. I know the only way of really making this work out is testing and adding the functionalities already made bit by bit.
