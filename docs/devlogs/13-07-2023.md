### Today's Progress: ðŸš€

There hasn't been much of progress today but I feel like what I started today will bring me much knowledge about client and server communication since I'm really at a loss on how to implement what I need. So now I finally started switching the front end into React instead of EJS because I'll have much more flexibility and hopefully will be able to learn some things from it. Now I need it to use routes. So I added React Router and now I have a clue on how to manage Oauth and my routes:

* I need to check if I'm logged already
* If not, switch the current page to Oauth page and log in
	* Show settings page, pick folders to track and root name
	* Render Home
* If yes, render home

Gods knows how I'll do that but I will.


### Challenges Faced: ðŸ’ª

And who knew adding a real front end instead of using a template engine could be so troublesome and increase project complexity that much. Personally, fiddling with two projects inside of one, one or more terminal for each stack is a lot of work beside having to change a lot of code to implement the new features.

### Thoughts and Reflections: ðŸ’­

There is so much to be done but I'm feeling optimistic it'll be alright.

### Plans for Tomorrow: ðŸ“™

I'm going to fix my routes, add a check to see if user is already logged, create settings page where I'll pick folders to track and the root default folder. Maybe add choose if ignore hidden folders.
