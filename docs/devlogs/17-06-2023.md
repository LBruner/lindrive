### Today's Progress: ðŸš€

Today I started the file update sysyem based on the file modification date, comparing the last local modified date and the date store last stored in the database. I remember having a though time comparing the dates the first time i tried this project. Who knew you only need to save the date converted to a string to solve that problem. 

I also made some changes and now Iâ€™m using the folder modification date in order to avoid reading into the files of a directory that didnâ€™t change.

### Challenges Faced: ðŸ’ª

### Thoughts and Reflections: ðŸ’­

Iâ€™m really happy with the progress I made. My app already does the basic of what I needed it to and after a few changes Iâ€™ll be ready to start using it even though I want to implement better logs so I can copy the GUI of Google Drive on Windows. 

### Plans for Tomorrow: ðŸ“™

Tommorow I venture into the unknown because Iâ€™ve never made it this far before. My main goal is for the system to detect if a file was deleted and remove its register from the db and Drive. Iâ€™d say the difficult part will be finding out where this logic will fit best on my code. Iâ€™ve made a lot of changes, my functions started growing and I didnâ€™t had the time to refactor the code yet.

### Additional Notes: ðŸ—’

I should start looking for a way to execute the program everytime something was updated and not based on time set.
