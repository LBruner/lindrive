### Today's Progress: ðŸš€

I finally managed to finish chokidar implementation on my project. And despite the problem of triggering all events at the same time, it is still way better than the system I had created before. Even better now that I managed to organize my code, create a class to expose chokidar functions that Iâ€™d use and set some functions to deal with offline node alterarion. Everything is working right now, i can create, update and delete files or folders and regardless of the server running or not, everything will be handled with itâ€™s respective action when the server starts again. 

### Challenges Faced: ðŸ’ª

Iâ€™ve really racked my brain trying to fix a typo which made my program not work. It was really at my nose and I got really deep in my application trying to find what was wrong. Now a real challege Iâ€™m facing is system architecture. Iâ€™m not sure that the main class I have is well structered. It does what itâ€™s supossed to but I think that maybe I should try to turn it the more generic I can. Maybe Iâ€™m watching my TS course too much. The instructor is doing a whole different project which really requires classes to be dinamic and be of different types.

### Thoughts and Reflections: ðŸ’­

The performance of my application is starting to get me worried because the RAM it uses is a lot. I still donâ€™t know if the whole Node process that appears on process manager is my application but it could be. Looking through my code I can find a lot of room to refactor such as not making x requests for each file I have.

### Plans for Tomorrow: ðŸ“™

Iâ€™m going to try using Sequelize to manage my DB without having to write queries by hand. I heard it supports type so Iâ€™m really excited to use something new and that can improve my code a lot.****

### Additional Notes: ðŸ—’

I still need to spend some time doing error handling.
