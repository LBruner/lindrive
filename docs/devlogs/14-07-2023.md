### Today's Progress: ðŸš€

The only thing I can call a progress today was adding a cookie to check if user is authenticated and based on it, call or not the oauth route on the backend. 

### Challenges Faced: ðŸ’ª

Challenges beat me down today. It started when I tried to get the full folder path through the select folder window on the browser and it only gave me the folder name. Then I realized that is forbidden to avoid security issues. And that broke my legs. It took me a long time to ask ChatGPT for alternatives and among them were ElectronJS. At first I thought it was gonna be pretty easy and soon found out I was damn wrong. I tried setting it up with Typescript first. And as it happens when I tried to set TS with frontend, a lot of erros showed up. So I tried only JS and still got errors. Then I watched a video of a guy using the tool `forge` and tried it on my project. It seems that it works, I could use it to get the folder full path now. But for some reason, now the dev window became really shy and doesn't want to show up. As long as I can make what I wanted before, I'll stick with this new tool. It'll be a great challenge because I have no idea on how to use Electron.

### Thoughts and Reflections: ðŸ’­

I might be spending too much time on this project.

### Plans for Tomorrow: ðŸ“™

Try to do the rest of the things I want from my frontend and see if Electron is enough for what I need. I'll also have to see some tutorials on the subject.
