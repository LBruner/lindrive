# Lindrive ðŸ’¾

## Introduction ðŸš€

Welcome to the development overview of **Lindrive**! This document provides an insight into the goals, technologies, and purpose behind the project. As of now, since I still got some features to implement and knowing the project can still change a lot,  I won't get into the details. You can find more details and my logs on it's creation on the [wiki](https://github.com/LBruner/lindrive/wiki) tab.

## Overview ðŸŒŸ

**Lindrive** is an ongoing development aimed at creating a similar experience to what Google Drive is on the Windows operating System. Currently, it doesn't have a Linux OS version available with the features it has on Windows. Being able to select a folder path and track it for changes being the most important one. So for this reason, besides being a great application to start growing my portfolio it will also help me personally.

## Technologies/Tools Used ðŸ’»

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- ElectronJS
-  Typescript
- Google Drive API
- React
- React Router
- Styled Components

## Development Progress ðŸš§

Currently, the project is in the alpha stage. I have completed most of the features I initially thought, those being:
* Log into Google Account using oAuth
* Add/Delete folders which are going to be watched for file changes
* Files and folders change reflex into Google Drive Account
* Logs are displayed on the UI

As said before, you can follow all the updates on this project through the [wiki](https://github.com/LBruner/lindrive/wiki) page tab!
